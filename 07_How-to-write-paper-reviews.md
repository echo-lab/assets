# Paper Review Guidelines

- Reviewing is an importnat part of how Academia runs. It is a volunteering work and you have to submit paper, that means that you own someone and reviewing papers is returning back to the community. 
- However, you have to set a limit. It is okay to decline paper reviews when your review requests are over your bandwidth, or you do not have expertise to review the paper. 


## Review Process Guidelines

- If a paper is nearly perfect and acceptable as is, the review can be entirely positive.
- The score given to a paper should correlate with the balance of positive and negative feedback. For borderline papers, the review should include an equal mix of positives and negatives.
- Reviews should be written in a manner that the reviewer would appreciate receiving themselves. Criticisms should be justified to avoid frustration.
- Reviewers should be able to introduce the paper to someone unfamiliar with it, summarizing the content and issues without requiring the reader to have read the paper.
- Practice your academic writing while reviewing a paper. A good paper is easy to review. It organizes the content in a well-structured way to find out where things are (e.g., contributions)

## Review Process Guidelines

What review score means
- Reject (1)  is something that has no chance of being accepted or when you feel offended to read the paper. (For some conference, e.g., CSCW, they don't have Probably reject so you have to use this one but if is 5-point scale or 7-point scale, the lowest score is rarely used unless you feel insulted. 
- Probably Reject (2)  is something that I give when I think I have to review this paper at least two more rounds because I don't want them to revise the paper and then reject it again. 
- Major revision (or Neutral/3) is something that I give when I think the paper is good but I would like to check if whether they made changes to my request.
- Minor revision (or Probably accept/4)is something that I give when I have a trust with the authors that they will be able to easily accomplish the changes that I request. 
- Accept (5) is the one that I give when it is fantastic as is - no single change is needed.
