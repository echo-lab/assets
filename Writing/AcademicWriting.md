# Help readers navigate and predict. 

## 3 rules on what to write in writing. 

- Say what you are going to say. (Have a topic sentence in front for every level e.g., paragraph, subsection, section, paper) 
- Say it. (Support the topic sentence) 
- Say what you said. (Summarize or reveal the reason why you build up) 

### 3 rules for paragaph

- (the first sentence) Start a paragraph with a topic sentence (why you are writing this paragraph). 
- (everything else) Write sentences that support the topic sentence 
- (the last sentence) Briefly summarize it at the end and tell them what they should take away from this paragraph. 

### rules for paper

- In the introduction, you should give them a summarized version of the whole paper, including motivation, goal, what we did (method), the result, and what we learned. Give them what they want and do not hide anything fora  later surprise. People hate surprises. Make them know what's upcoming. Make the paper predictable. 
- One common mistake is to save something good for later. This is bad. Readers are not a captive audience who will be sitting on a desk until they finish reading. (Movie theater vs. Netflix) If they don't get it in the first few paragraphs, they will leave. A similar mistake is to try to surprise readers. Don't try to impress readers with surprise. Make your paper sound predictable so that they can expect what I am going to say.

### one way to write the abstract

- One or two sentences to explain the context and the significance of it.
- One or two sentences to explain the problem that we are trying to solve/study.
- One or two sentences to explain the goal of the study, which may involve what we did (e.g., The goal of the study is to study how we can use technologies to solve X)
- One or two sentences to explain what we did (method)
- One or two sentences to explain the (anticipated) result
- (optional) One or two sentences to explain the implication/contribution of the work to the world.  
 
### rules for subsection/section

- The very first sentence of the subsection/section should describe what the section is about. 
- If you stick to this principle, you should be able to write a draft of an abstract by collecting the first sentence of each section. 
- Make as many subsections and sections as possible. The section title will be signposts that help them navigate. Imagine a highway that has lots of exits without any signs. 
- Avoid general section titles if possible (e.g., introduction, discussion, result, etc). Think of a sign that says "exit" vs. "exit: rest area" on a highway; which is more informative?  

## Let them understand what I want to tell them by 

- reading the title (5 seconds version of your paper) 
- reading the abstract (1-minute version of your paper) 
- reading the introduction (5-minute version of your paper) 

# Do not make readers guess. 

## If you use a pronoun, they have to guess

- Don't use "this" alone. They cannot see your index finger. 

## When you use Comparative adjectives 

- If you use comparative adjectives (e.g., more, better, quicker), use "than" and specify what you compare with. 

## Avoid ambiguous expression 

- one sentence should be interpreted only in one way (e.g.,

## Use active voice

- Using passive voice is a sneaky way to skip the subject ("by whom"), thereby making readers guess what the subject of a sentence is.

- 

# Be inclusive.

## use gender-neutral terms if possible 

- layman --> layperson, for example.
- Using "they" as a singular pronoun is recommended. (instead of he or she)



# Make it easy to read. 

## Write it in a way you can understand when someone reads it aloud to you. (use TTS and see if you can understand).  

- (more to come) 

## Avoid using multiple S+V pairs in one sentence. 

- (more to come) 

## Write a sentence and make it shorter than the span of a few lines. If you wrote it in more than 2 lines, consider breaking them into two. 





# Be scientific. 

- "Scientific" simply means "numbers". 
- Cite as much as possible. Don't think that it is only the Related Work section that needs citation. I cannot imagine a thesis that has no citation in its introduction, for example. If you don't havea  citation, imagine that what you wrote will be perceived as your unwarranted opinions, not something scientifically proven. If you cite a paper from the past, that means that you will have evidence that supports your claims.

# Structure of an Academic Paper

- Title --> 10-second version of your paper
- Abstract --> 2-minute version of your paper
- Introduction (motivation) --> 5-minute version of your paper
  - preview results 
  - research questions 
  - hypothesis
  - goals 
- Related Works --> What people have done in the past (b/c we want to know the boundary)  (before your work) 
  - novelty - how we are different from other works. 
  - significance - but people care about this problem. 
- Method
  - what we did, e.g., build a system 
  - how we validated our claim, e.g.,  validated the system with a user study 
- Result
- Discussion  (after your work) 
  - causal inference
  - before vs. after  ( mirrored Related works) 
- (Limitation) 
  - Frame every limitation you have as (a) yes, a possible weakness, (b) not actually a large problem, and (c) an opportunity for future work. (Credit: Jacob Thebault-Spieker) 
  - Think of the limitation section like the last diss battle in 8 Miles (you diss yourself so your opponent has nothing to say but claim that you are still cool even with all the flaws.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7UQHgZZAfU
- (Future Work) 
- Conclusion --> 3-minute version of your paper
  - summarize result

# Research Questions (or equivalent) 
- Research questions are essential. I know you can see lots of papers where RQs are skipped, but that does not mean you're fine without them. You should have them internally at least. If you are not including them in a paper, that's perhaps because you don't have good research questions. 
- Reading good RQs can help readers expect what the research contribution will be (knowledge, what we get to know more about the world if we complete the study), guess how they are going to accomplish the goal (methods), and understand what the impact will be (significance/purpose/problem).
- The easiest way to get a paper rejected is to provide incorrect RQs. The answers to the research questions should be available within the paper. 
- Make sure that your RQs are not centered around tools/technology - don't ask RQ because we can.. (e.g., How can we use new AR technology for remote meetings?). Make it for a purpose. (e.g., How can we facilitate seamless integration of remote participants using AR technologies?) 

# Tense

- (Past tense) 
  - when describing what people have done in the past. 
  - when describing what you did in your method (implementation/user study) 
- (Future tense) 
  - Nope. No future tense is used in academic writing unless it is a proposal. Not even for future work. (Say we "plan to") unless you are 100% sure that you "will" do it, which cannot be true. 
- (Present perfect tense) 
  - When you want to say what people "have done". This means that there is a body of work that multiple researchers have worked on the topic that you describe. 
- (Present tense) 
  - everything else.

# Some random advice
  
  - The art of academic writing is not to impress readers but to make it difficult to disagree with you. 
  - Don't say "I am particularly interested in" "We are interested in...." Nobody is interested in knowing what you're interested in. Justify the significance (why it matters) and the scope (what's covered in this paper and thus what the limitation is). Or the other way to say the same thing in a less sarcastic way: it is not convincing to say "because I am interested in XXXX" to the question of "why it matters?" Tell readers why this should be of everyone's interest rather.
  - Avoid inventing a new acronym unless you are going to use it so many times that it is much more convenient to do so. If the existing literature uses the acronym widely, it is acceptable to use it.
  - Once  an acronym is introduced, you can assume that they will know the acronym (or it is their responsibility to remember it), which is why I do not think introducing a new acronym should be avoided as much as possible. If it is HCI, they will know what it is, but for something that you invented, they would have to remember it.  Anyway, you don't have to introduce it multiple times. (Introducing it inthe  abstract and introduction is fine.) 


# Some common errors in style

- Put space in front of parenthesis or even avoid having parenthesis. 
- Put period at the end of the sentence even after the citation. ( This is a great work [13]. --> Good. / This is a great work. [13] --> Bad) 
- Hyphen is needed when multiple words are used as an adjective ( real-time communication vs. in real time) 
- Avoid using multiple conjunctions, such as "and", in one sentence. It is going to be probably ambiguous. Write the same thing in multiple sentence. 
- A comma is needed when there are more than two items in your list. (A and B --> A, B, and C) 

# Writing Correctness and Style Pet Peeves (Prof. Tamara Munzner)
## Correctness
- Avoid contractions in formal technical writing
- Every figure must be referenced in the main body text
- "it's" is a contraction for "it is", not a possessive 
- Citations are grammatically invisible; you shouldn't use them for nouns. Correct: "The PivotGraph system [13] features a derived aggregate network". Incorrect: "Aggregation is also used in [13]".
- whether to hyphenate a noun phrase depends on how it is used. Use "foo bar" when a noun phrase is used as a noun, and "foo-bar" when the phrase is used as an adjective. Correct: "we lay out elements end to end in a line" (noun), "we make an end-to-end argument as in networking" (adjective).
- In a similar spirit, "lay out" is a verb and "layout" is a noun. Correct: "we lay out the graph splendidly" (verb use), "the layout is splendid because" (noun use).
- Please get principal/principle right. principal = main, principle = idea. PCA stands for Principal Components Analysis. PI stands for Principal Investigator.
## References
- In a bibliography, always always hand-check the BibTeX that you get off the web. It's usually inconsistent or incomplete.
- be consistent with journal/conference names. no need for a publisher address unless it's someplace obscure, and no need for a publisher if it's implicit in the conf/journal name (i.e., IEEE/ACM), and no need for the location of the conference. always double-check that the pages are in there (both the start and end page!). The only acceptable exceptions are when it really is an online-only venue where there are no explicit pages (examples include the BELIV workshop proceedings or the Foundations and Trends in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction journal).
- also be concise and consistent: 'Trans.' not 'Transactions', 'Symp.' not 'Symposium', 'Conf.' not 'Conference'. don't include words like "of the" or "on". Don't ever say 'pages', just 'p.'
- do include the accepted nickname/shortname for conferences in parentheses after the long name. don't include the year after that nickname, it's already communicated by the year that comes at the end of the citation.
- example of bad bibliography snarfed off the web:
- "M. Wattenberg. A note on space-filling visualizations and space-filling curves. In Proc. of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (INFOVIS'05), volume 0, page 24, Los Alamitos, CA, USA, 2005. IEEE Computer Society."

  after fixing:

  "M. Wattenberg. A note on space-filling visualizations and space-filling curves. In Proc. IEEE Symp. Information Visualization (InfoVis), p 181-186, 2005"

- if you're pressed for space, change long author lists to 'FirstAuthor et al'. I normally do full names for four or less, and switch to et al for five or more. The way to do this in latex/bibtex is "John Smith and others" for author list.

- make sure that you've got the right capitalization in titles using curly braces around elements that should not be lowercased automatically. Main offenders are "D" (3D, ND), acronyms, and camelcase names.
- in short: check your bibliography *very carefully*. do not be sloppy and inconsistent. be assured that i will notice.

## Style
- The issues below are stylistic choices - I'm not saying the other way is technically incorrect, I'm saying I have such a strong preference for this way that I will change it whenever I edit.
- avoid parentheses whenever possible, they interrupt flow. It's OK to use them when defining acronyms, but otherwise I try to hold myself to only one parenthetical remark per paper.
- avoid e.g. and i.e., spell out "such as" or "for example" instead. Again, it's a flow issue.
- minimize use of possessives with nouns. So instead of "feature's sequences", say "sequences of a feature". it's easier to parse.
- avoid "this" without a noun after it, especially at the beginning of a sentence. Instead of "This shows that we are fabulous", say "This situation shows that we are fabulous", to make the referent unambiguous.

  in more detail from Ullman, on "Avoid non-referential this"

  While it sounds pedantic at first, you get a huge increase in clarity by chasing the "nonreferential this" from students' writing. Many students (and others) use "this" to refer to a whole concept rather than a noun. For example: "If you turn the sproggle left, it will jam, and the glorp will not be able to move. This is why we foo the bar." Now the writer of this prose fully understands about sproggles and glorps, so they know whether we foo the bar because glorps do not move, or because the sproggle jammed. It is important for students to put themselves in the place of their readers, who may be a little shaky on how sproggles and glorps work, and need a more carefully written paragraph.

- always use the Oxford/serial comma with lists. instead of "we have apples, oranges and bananas for sale", say "we have apples, oranges, and bananas for sale". The final comma is critical for resolving ambiguity in some situations. Like this one: http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/merle-haggard-and-the-gay-serial-comma/
- avoid the passive voice, use active voice. passive voice makes your text too ambiguous about who is the agent of action.
- you must have some prose between section and subsection header
- avoid "in this section we do XXX". just *do* XXX!
- emphasize a word (with bold or italics, as you prefer) when you first *define* it, not when you first *use* it. ideally the definition and the first use are the same. but it might be a sentence or two later.
- firstly vs. first is admittedly an issue of personal preference. i strongly prefer the latter. let me bring your attention to a quote from Elements of Style: "Do not dress words up by adding 'ly' to them, as though putting a hat on a horse."
- avoid double negatives, use a positive instead because it's easier to parse
- use parallel structure when possible, both at the level of sentences in a paragraph and at the level of section naming. Correct: Naming Foo, Linking Bar, Adding Bat. Incorrect: Name Foo, Linking Bar, Bat Additions.
- avoid switching between tenses unless you have a very good reason to do so. usually what you're reporting on in the paper should stay in the present tense (Correct: "the system is designed to do foo". Incorrect: "the system was designed to do foo".) past tense should be reserved for things truly in the past, like what users did during a user study.
- for captions, use parentheses around the subfigure labels to distinguish them "(a) blah blah". Always have a (possibly short) bit saying what the full figure does before starting with subfigure descriptions. Each subfigure should have its own label, rather than having a continuing sentence where you mention subfigure bits as you go. Correct: "Key aspects of foobar. (a) The first thing. (b) The second thing." Incorrect: "The first thing is great (a), and I love the second thing (b) too".
